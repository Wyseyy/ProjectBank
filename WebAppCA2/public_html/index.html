            <h2>How does it work></h2>
            How it works is all countries with a national football team compete against on another in group stages, during these specific group stages, all countries have a chance, the top two teams of each group qualify, with 31 teams qualifying for the world cup group stages, the 32nd team is always the host, after that, those 32 teams have to get top two in their group again to qualify for the round of 16 knockout stages, with the bottom two teams being eliminated, after that, every match determines how far they go, winning the round of 16 permits them into the quarter finals, with the final 8 teams making up the quarter finals matches, winning that game permits them into the semi-finals, which the final four teams make up, winning that then, puts them into the final, with the winner of that match being crowned as champions of the world and the strongest team in the world. With the previous winners being France in 2018, Germany in 2014, and Spain in 2010.
